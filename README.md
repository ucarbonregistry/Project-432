_______________
The project, RDF based Power Generation Plant is located in Jawahar Nagar Village, MedchalMalkajgiri District, Telangana State, INDIA.
Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to Electricity Generation is one of the major waste-to-energy
technologies that allows MSW to be directly combusted into waste-to-energy facilities as a fuel
with minimal processing (known as Mass Burn). Alternatively, the technology also allows
combustion of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) that is produced after the MSW undergoes moderate to
extensive processing. This technology presents the opportunity for both electricity production as
well as an alternative to land filling or composting of MSW.

The 24 MW Municipal Solid Waste to electricity generation project essentially undertakes the
generation of electricity from the Refuse Derived Fuel produced from the municipal solid waste of
the city of Hyderabad.

The production of electricity from processed municipal solid waste i.e., RDF and synchronizing
with grid was done at the project site located at Jawahar Nagar village, Medchal-District,
Telangana. The technology provides yet another source of renewable energy similar to that of wind
energy and solar energy for power generation best suited for energy intensive Indian cities. The
input fuel (RDF) is a coal substitute, further unlike coal, RDF has no shellac and has less ash
content.
_______________
The project uses the renewable fuel like RDF, thus the RDF based projects have practical
availability of fuels for running of plant and thus use of coal (GHG emission) is not required for
running of plant.
The power plant has a condensing steam turbo generator with travelling grate boiler of firing fuels,
resulting in efficient burning of RDF.
